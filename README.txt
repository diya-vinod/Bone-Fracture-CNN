Python
Code is written in Jupyter Notebook and attached as an .ipynb file. The training, validation, and testing data are in separate folders. First the code preprocesses the data by normalizing and augmenting the training images. Rescaling is done to all images. Then we make the CNN architecture, train it on the data, and monitor the validation performance. Then it the model is run on the testing data, and we evaluate the performance of the model.
To run this code, you will need Tensorflow, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn installed on your device. First, upload the .ipynb to an IDE. I prefer Jupyter Notebook, but Google Colab, VS Code, or similar alternatives will work as well. When uploading make sure that the "data" folder is in the same directory as the .ipynb. Inside the "data" folder, there should be folders with the train, test, and validation images. From there you can run the code cell by cell. One important thing to note is that cell 8 can take an extremely long time to run, I strongly recommend not rerunning that cell. In this cell, the we trained the CNN and with a CPU it took a significant amount of time. The specific cell is indicated in the code.
